<h2 id="about">About me</h2>

<p id="text_about">
    I am currently in my 5th semester in ISCL (International Studies of Computational Linguistics) at the University
    of Tubingen.<br> After completing my Bachelor’s degree, I plan to commence my Master’s in ISCL the following
    winter of 2025. <br>Throughout my academic journey, I have gained extensive experience in implementing (Deep)
    Neural Networks with frameworks like <b>pytorch</b>, designing various (machine learning) algorithms to solve core NLP
    problems, and creating user-friendly interfaces for other people/systems to use my tools.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have most experience with <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, AI in the context of <b>NLP</b>, <b>linguistics</b>, <b>competitive programming.</b> <br>
    My work so far spans within various areas of technical support and automation, as well as speech/text processing, sequence labeling, machine translation for low-resourced
    languages, information retrieval, and language modeling.
